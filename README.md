### Overview:
This is the repo for the project of CSE 230. In this repo, we plan to implement a variant of the classic strategy board game Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row. The outcome of the project will be a line application based on the [brick](!https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/) library.

### Description of Five in a Row:
The game is played on a grid board with a certain size. Players take turns to place their stones on the intersections of the grids. The goal of the game for each player is to create an unbroken row of fine stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this goal wins the game. 

### Objective of project:
A line application of our variant of Five in a Row based on the brick library. The application will be implemented with the following features:

### Features:
+ Undo Move: Players can retract their moves.
+ Online Support: Players can connect and compete with others over the internet or LAN.
+ "Throwing Knife": Each player is granted a single opportunity to remove any pieces within a specified 2x2 square area on the board, potentially disrupting the opponent's progress or clearing a path for their own victory.
